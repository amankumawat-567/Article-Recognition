## Overview

This project utilizes a transformer-based approach to recognize articles. The methodology considers each article number as a separate class, with both short and long text inputs being processed through embedding layers.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- TensorFlow (for implementing the Transformer model)
- GPU (recommended for faster training)
- A large dataset of articles
- A basic understanding of machine learning and neural networks

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Loading

The dataset is loaded from an Excel file located in Google Drive. The notebook starts by mounting Google Drive and loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame.

## Data Preprocessing

The notebook processes the loaded data to extract useful columns and prepare it for model training. This includes:
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
- Label encoding the target variable (article numbers) to transform them into numerical values suitable for modeling.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture involves a transformer-based model designed to predict article numbers. Key components include:

### Self-Attention

Self-attention is a mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence relative to each other. It helps in understanding the context by focusing on relevant words when generating embeddings for a given word.

### Multi-Head Attention

Multi-head attention consists of several self-attention mechanisms run in parallel, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the sentence simultaneously. Each head independently performs self-attention and the results are concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final output. This allows the model to capture different types of relationships and features from the input data.

### Feed-Forward Layers

Feed-forward layers are fully connected layers applied independently to each position in the sequence. In a transformer model, each attention output is passed through a feed-forward neural network, which consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. These layers help in transforming the attention outputs into more abstract representations.

### Attention Layers

Attention layers in a transformer model are composed of self-attention or multi-head attention mechanisms followed by normalization and feed-forward layers. They are stacked multiple times to form the transformer architecture, allowing the model to capture complex relationships in the data through multiple layers of abstraction.

## Training

The model is trained using the preprocessed data with the following steps:
- Setting up hyperparameters such as the number of epochs and batch size.
- Using a training loop to iterate over the data in batches and perform training steps.
- Tracking metrics such as classification loss and accuracy during the training process.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated to assess its performance. Evaluation typically involves:
- Splitting the data into training and validation sets.
- Using evaluation metrics like accuracy and loss to measure model performance.

## Results

Training results include tracking metrics such as:
- Classification loss.
- Classification accuracy.
- The progress is tracked and checkpoints are saved periodically.
